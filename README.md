# [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

Project Euler is a website that hosts fun mathematical and computational problems to be solved with the help of programming skills. Since the website only asks for the correct answer for the problem, I decided to create this repository to save the codes I'll be making.

Initialy, most solutions will be done in Python, since it's the only programming langugage I know enough to solve them, but I plan to solve and rewrite some solutions in C/Rust in the future.

Obs: The codes hosted in here may not (and probably will not for that matter lol) be the most well written or the fastest, but they'll, hopefully, work. (=
